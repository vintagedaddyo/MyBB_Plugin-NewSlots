Plugin Description: This is a simple slot machine for risking your MYPS points in the hopes of winning more.  Currently you can set how much each spin costs in admincp.  The win is decided on a multiplication of the spin cost.  The top 2 wins are hard to achieve as I have created an extra random algorithm for them.  MYPS plugin is of course required.

Installation

1. Upload the files from the zip

root/slots.php
root/inc/plugins/slots.php
(for the images make sure to upload them to each of your themes images directory)

2. Login to your admincp and ACTIVATE the plugin (Slots) in the plugin manager.

3. You will see the new menu item called "SLots" inside admincp settings.

4. Change the settings to suit your sites needs.

This version has no language support. I may change that in next version.

optional: Inside extras folder is slotback.png for you to make your own spin icons.  You can use the images/slots/6.png as well.

troubleshooting: If the header image does not appear you will need to simply add it manually to your navigation system.  The link is slots.php and the image link is in toplinks/slots.png.
