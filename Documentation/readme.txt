Plugin Description: This is a simple slot machine for risking your NewPoints points in the hopes of winning more.  Currently you can set how much each spin costs in admincp.  The win is decided on a multiplication of the spin cost.  The top 2 wins are hard to achieve as I have created an extra random algorithm for them.  NewPoints plugin is of course required.

Installation

1. Upload the contents within the Upload directory to your forums root directory

2. Login to your admincp and ACTIVATE the plugin (Slots) in the plugin manager.

3. You will see the new menu item called "Slots" inside admincp settings.

4. Change the settings to suit your sites needs.

Note: This version has language support. 

optional: Inside extras folder is slotback.png for you to make your own spin icons.  You can use the images/slots/6.png as well.

troubleshooting: If the header image does not appear you will need to simply add it manually to your navigation system.  The link is slots.php and the image link is in toplinks/slots.png.
